I am a PhD student in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence at ETH Zürich, advised by Dr. Christos Sakaridis and Prof. Konrad Schindler. Previously, I earned my master's degree from the School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Belgrade. My current research interests lie in **VLMs**, **VLAs**, **Vision-Language Grounding,** **and Robotics**. My long-term goal is to develop **robotic foundation models with strong perception, reasoning, and planning capabilities**, enabling scalable and reliable autonomous systems.

<!-- ## Hobbies

In my leisure time, I enjoy sports like running, table tennis, and swimming. During my time at Tsinghua University, I was an amateur long-distance runner. In 2019, I completed a half marathon (21.0975 km) in 1 h 30 min and a full marathon (42.195 km) in 3 h 36 min. However, since starting my PhD I haven’t had time for regular running training, so I’ve let it slide. Hopefully I’ll get a chance to update my record once I graduate🙂. -->
